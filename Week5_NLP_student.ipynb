    "In this week's exercise, we will apply neural networks to a new type of data - text. You will also pick your own corpus of text to play with.  **But first, some definitions** (there's a lot of new jargon in 'NLP'):\n",
    "* *Corpus*: The set of all text documents you want to work on\n",
    "* *Document*: An individual unit of text in your corpus\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some **examples of corpora** to get you thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Corpus of 100,000 IMDB reviews, where each document is an individual review\n",
    "* Corpus of 20 English novels, where each document is an individual novel\n",
    "* Corpus of one Malay novel, where each document is a chapter\n",

    "* https://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/\n",

    "If this is your first time working with text, it's probably easier to deal with a corpus of many short documents - for example the IMDB review dataset, which is linked below in Chapter 2.

Remember text doesn't have to be English (try other languages), or even a natural language (try code or musical notation)!\n",

    "* http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/ - great course that introduces theory and concepts of text processing in the context of deep learning (can read class notes / assignments and skip videos if you are short on time) \n",
    "* https://course.fast.ai/index.html - fast.ai's introduction to deep learning (you'll have to pick out the bits about text and RNNs) is an efficient and effective way of tackling the topic\n",

You can use PyTorch or Tensorflow (Keras is too high level for this exercise), both of which will automatically handle backpropagation for you.  If you use Tensorflow, please research and use Eager execution - it replaces Tensorflow's default graph / session framework, which is very difficult to learn and debug.\n",

Consider appropriate sizes for your input, hidden and output layers - your __init__ method should take in the params `hidden_size`, `vocab_size`, and `embedding_size` (if you use embeddings). Using these variables, you should initialise three weight layers `input_layer`, `hidden_layer`, and `output_layer`.  In an RNN, you will also have to deal with another item - the `hidden_state`. (Note: your RNN structure may vary slightly from this depending on your learning materials, but the key part is always `hidden_state`)\n",
